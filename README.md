🚀 Data Jobs Market Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Introduction

This project was designed to solve a real problem faced by job seekers, career switchers, and early-stage data professionals: data job market information is fragmented and difficult to interpret.

Using a real-world dataset of 2024 global data job postings, this dashboard provides a single, interactive platform to explore hiring demand, compensation trends, geographic distribution, and career pathways across the data industry.

The goal was not just to build a dashboard, but to turn raw job market data into actionable career insights.

🧠 Key Insights Generated
📈 1. Data Engineering is the most in-demand role

Analysis showed that Data Engineering roles (~129K postings) had the highest demand in 2024, followed by Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles. This indicates that organisations are prioritising data infrastructure, pipelines, and scalable platforms as a foundation for advanced analytics and AI.

🎯 2. Strong hiring for entry and mid-level professionals

The dashboard highlighted a significantly higher volume of entry and mid-level roles compared to senior positions. This suggests that companies are scaling data teams and building foundational capabilities, creating strong opportunities for early-career professionals.

💰 3. Machine Learning Engineers command premium salaries

Despite lower job volume, Machine Learning Engineers had the highest compensation. This reflects the high business value of production-grade AI systems, model deployment, and software engineering capabilities.

🌍 4. Global demand is led by the USA and India

The USA had the largest job volume, followed by India. This reflects both the maturity of the US data ecosystem and the rapid expansion of data capabilities in emerging markets.

🔗 5. LinkedIn dominates as the hiring platform

LinkedIn accounted for the highest number of job postings, highlighting the importance of professional networking and targeted recruitment in the data industry.

📉 6. Hiring shows strong seasonality

Demand peaked early and mid-year, with a noticeable slowdown in Q4, likely driven by budget cycles and hiring freezes. Hiring began recovering towards year-end.
